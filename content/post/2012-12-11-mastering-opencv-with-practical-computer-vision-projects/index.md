I feel excited writing this post. The **"Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects"** books is done and published! This is my first experience as a book author and i hope you will like it. This book has been written by several authors, and covers many topics that has real appliance in computer vision area: augmented reality, face recognition and head pose estimation, structure from motion estimation and cartoon image processing. We as authors made our best to bring the most popular and demanded topics to you.
