Hi, and welcome to Computer Vision Talks blog!

I've started writing about computer vision in 2010. 

A lot of things happened since that. I've participated in many exciting projects, [wrote book](/post/2012-12-11-mastering-opencv-with-practical-computer-vision-projects/), grew new skills and
found many new friends. This page is not a CV, but rather a hall of fame with a list of buzzwords describing techs I've worked with:

* Monocular SLAM
* 3D scene reconstruction from point cloud
* Object recognition
* 3D Visualization
* Marker-less and marker-based augmented reality
* Computer vision and image processing
* Real-time media processing

Hope you enjoy reading my blog.
