    | I welcome you at my new blog home! After using Wordpress for three years of bloging i decided that i'm unhappy with this blog engine.
    | Personally, i wanted something more "geeky", if you know what i mean. Wordpress is like a "click to win" - it offers a lot, but keeps you
    | in strict sandbox called Wordpress API. But first of all - it's too slow as a blogging platform for one people.

p
    | Computer Vision Talks is not updates daile or even weekly (I wish i could have enough time to write posts!). So for me it was very wierd to experience 2-3-5 seconds
    | of loading a single page. Don't get me wrong - my hosting is fine. Making a dozens of SQL requests to render a single HTML page? It's wrong by design. So i came to a decision
    | to use static-site generator. Geeeky enough, isn't it? First, i've heard about Jekyl from a Radio-T podcast. I'm a big fan of it and there i heard about Octopress. It looked nice
    | but outdated and has small community. After a while i found Wintersmith - amazing tool for static blogging.

p 
    | The new site look is still not final, so it appearance is about to change slightly from time to time. I hope you enjoy reading it.
    | And I hope i'll now have more time to write interesting articles!
