    | Meanwhile, after watching this brilliant talk of the Alexander Soloviov on "Functional Reactive Programming and Closure Script" i decided to study Functional Programming. 
    | Fortunately, there was a active course 
    a(href="https://class.coursera.org/progfun-003/class/index") Functional Programming Principles in Scala
    |.

    | My first impressions on Scala is... it's fun! 
    | Thinking in functional programming paradigm makes you think different about your objects and their connection to each other. 
    | And i'm curious how Scala can be used for solving main computer vision problems. I will try to write marker detection algorithm in Scala for curiosity. 
    | PS: My russian-speaking readers can watch the inspirational talk on YouTube:
