Let me introduce you [Adrian Rosebrock][5] and his [http://www.pyimagesearch.com/][1] website. 
It's about computer vision and image processing using Python and OpenCV. 
Looks like there are more than one person that like to share programming experience via blogging :)

Here's how [Adrian][1] position himself:

> This blog is dedicated to helping other programmers understand how image search engines work. 
> While a lot of computer vision concepts are theoretical in nature, 
> I’m a big fan of “learning by example”. My goal is to distill my life experiences in building image search engines into concise, easy to understand examples.

I hope you will enjoy reading Adrian's posts on [superpixels][7], [histogram matching][6] and [color clustering][8].
In addition, he wrote a book on using OpenCV in Python.
