p ARBasketball was one of the first augmented reality-based games in App Store. It has been published in 2010. In these days not many people have even heard about AR. I mean it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so popular as it became now. But there were people who saw the great potential in this growing market. One of them was Konstantin Tarovik, the author of ARBasketball. I must confess - I saw this application before, but had no idea it&amp;rsquo;s author lives in Ukraine, and in the same city as I am!</description>

        <description>I continue playing with powerful NEON engine in iPhone and iPad devices. Recently i bought iPhone 4S that replaced my HTC Mozart and i decided to check how to speed upÂ BGRA to GRAY color conversion procedure using multithreading. Recently Itseez announced a minor release of OpenCV 2.4.3 with a lot of new major features:
 Added universal parallel_for implementation using various backends: TBB, OpenMP, GCD, Concurrency Improved OpenCV Manager, new Java samples framework, better camera support on Android, opencv2.</description>

        <description>Almost all image processing algorithms uses gray scale images as input source. But almost all hardware video sources provide frames in RGB/BGR(A) formats. So gray scale conversion is very popular operation. Although it&amp;rsquo;s expensive enough to cause CPU-bound bottlenecks while running on mobile processors. In this post i will show you how to use ARM NEON intrinsic to get significant performance boost of BGRA to GRAY conversion.
Color representation Pixel color can be presented in different ways.</description>
