p | Meanwhile, after watching this brilliant talk of the Alexander Soloviov on &amp;ldquo;Functional Reactive Programming and Closure Script&amp;rdquo; i decided to study Functional Programming. | Fortunately, there was a active course a(href=&amp;ldquo;https://class.coursera.org/progfun-003/class/index&amp;quot;) Functional Programming Principles in Scala |.
p | My first impressions on Scala is&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s fun! | Thinking in functional programming paradigm makes you think different about your objects and their connection to each other. | And i&amp;rsquo;m curious how Scala can be used for solving main computer vision problems.</description>

      <description>With this post i start describing my experience with a &amp;ldquo;Image and video processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the hospital&amp;rdquo; class. I will write a series of 9 posts each week i complete and highlight interesting tasks and solution to optional programming quizzes in OpenCV.
Week 1 The first week was very easy, just an introduction to image processing with explanation of basics and fundamental things. Took a day to see all video lectures and answer questions.</description>

      <description>This is a second part of &amp;ldquo;Image and video processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the hospital&amp;rdquo; class.
In optional taks for Week 2 we were asked to test various predictors for JPEG-LS compression algorithm. In this post i want to share my results and discuss how we can achieve better prediction rate. Compare prediction algorithms for loseless image compression Problem statement
 Compute the histogram of a given image and of its prediction errors.</description>
